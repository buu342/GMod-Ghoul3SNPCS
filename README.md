### FAQ
**Q:** Are they all 1 hit kill?<br/>
**A:** Yes, but at least they don't have thousands of HP. They're balanced off crossbow shots. Each take different amount of hits, but no one should take more than 5.<br/><br/>

**Q:** Sjas does not teleport away when shot, he just moves away. Why?<br/>
**A:** The map where you're playing does not have navigation meshes. Do nav_generate in the console.<br/><br/>

**Q:** How does Yurei work?<br/>
**A:** I can't tell you as that spoils the fun.<br/><br/>

**Q:** Multiplayer?<br/>
**A:** Yes, these are coded to fully function in multiplayer, even with 200+ ping.<br/><br/>

**Q:** What kind of pictures show up?<br/>
**A:** The images are all from movies or tv series. You won't get any gore bullshitt with me. If you're still hesitant, [here's the list of images](https://i.imgur.com/yzbDDBF.png).<br/><br/>

**Q:** What map?<br/>
**A:** [gm_horrorforest](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=297389768), [gm_shambles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=151544081), [slash_selvage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=798554357)<br/><br/>

**Q:** What weapons?<br/>
**A:** Custom made for a WIP gamemode.<br/><br/>

**Q:** Where are the ghoul sprites from?<br/>
**A:** They're taken mostly from halloween masks. [This thread](http://cutstuff.net/forum/index.php?topic=400.msg#msg) contains the information.

**Q:** Can you please make X?<br/>
**A:** No. I'm fine with taking suggestions but don't ask me to make stuff for you. I have my own projects and things to do, and making something for someone I've never met for no incentive whatsoever is not one of them. I am perfectly fine with adding additional content to my current work, however.<br/><br/>
